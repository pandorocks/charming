# CHARMING — Agent Guide

## Project

**Charming** is a Rails-inspired terminal user interface (TUI) framework for **Ruby 4+**. It is a **bundler gem** (`charming.gemspec`) providing applications, routing, controller actions, application state, views, components, rendering, generators, and a command palette — with an internal terminal backend layered behind `MemoryBackend` and `TTYBackend`.

## Key Architecture

```
Application → Router → Controller → ApplicationState → View → Component → UI
                              Runtime → Renderer → TTY/Memory Backend
```

- **Runtime** is the main loop: reads events from the backend, dispatches to controller (action keys, timer keys) or components, renders the response.
- A fresh controller instance is created **per dispatch**. Never store state on the controller.
- **Application state** is the only place for persistent TUI state; state objects are stored in `session` via `Controller#state(name, klass, **attrs)`.
- **Components** inherit from `View` to reuse assign readers and helpers (`text`, `box`, `row`, `column`, `render_component`).

### What goes in `session`

Because controllers are ephemeral, `session` is the only home for anything that must
outlive one event. It holds exactly three kinds of values:

1. **`ApplicationState` objects** via `state(name, klass, **attrs)` — domain state
   (persisted by `persist_session` only where JSON-safe).
2. **Primitive widget-state hashes** via `component_state(name, **defaults)` — the
   blessed idiom for interactive components: store JSON-safe primitives, rebuild the
   component from the hash each event, write changed values back after `handle_key`.
   The command palette, forms, focus, and sidebar all work this way, and these hashes
   survive `persist_session`.
3. **Runtime engine handles** — objects that wrap a live process or terminal-protocol
   state, e.g. `session[:audio] ||= Audio::Player.new` or an `Image::Source` (its
   `transmitted?` flag gates a one-time transmission). These are deliberately built
   once and are **intentionally dropped** by `save_session`.

Do **not** store live view/component objects (TextInput, List, …) in `session` — they
are silently dropped on persist and their mutable state belongs in a
`component_state` hash instead.

## Key APIs

### Application

```ruby
class MyApp < Charming::Application
  routes do
    root "home#index"
  end
end
```

### Controller

```ruby
class HomeController < Charming::Controller
  key "up", :increment
  key "down", :decrement
  key "q", :quit

  command "Quit", :quit

  timer :blink, every: 0.5, action: :toggle_spinner

  def show
    render counter.name
  end

  def index
    render_index
  end

  def increment
    counter.value += 1
    show
  end

  private
  def counter
    @counter ||= state(:counter, CounterState)
  end
end
```

### ApplicationState

```ruby
class CounterState < Charming::ApplicationState
  attribute :value, :integer, default: 0
end
```

### Components

Components expose `handle_key(event)` for interactive widgets. Return conventions:

| Return value       | Meaning              |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `:handled`        | Key consumed          |
| `[:selected, obj]`| Item selected         |
| `:cancelled`       | Cancelled (e.g. ESC) |
| `nil`              | Not handled           |

Components currently inherit from `View` and use `render` to produce the displayed string.

### Audio playback

`Charming::Audio::Player` plays a sound file by shelling out to a system audio binary
(no new gem dependency). Backends are resolved in priority order: `ffplay` (from ffmpeg)
on any platform, then OS-native players — `afplay` on macOS; `paplay`, `mpg123`, `aplay`
on Linux — raising `Charming::Audio::Player::Unavailable` when none are installed. The
player is **not** a view object: it holds a live child process, so keep it in `session`
(e.g. `session[:audio] ||= Charming::Audio::Player.new`) rather than rebuilding it per
render. For non-blocking playback plus clean teardown on quit, drive it from a `run_task`:

```ruby
run_task(:audio) do
  player.play(sound_path)
  player.wait
ensure
  player.stop   # no-op on normal finish; reaps the child if shutdown interrupts the task
end
```

`Charming::Components::Audio` is the optional one-line status view (`▶`/`■` + label) that
reads `player.playing?`. The `System` adapter (`Charming::Audio::System`) is injectable so
specs never shell out.

---

### Image display

`Charming::Image::Source` displays an image inline using the **Kitty graphics protocol**
with Unicode placeholders (supported terminals so far: **Ghostty** and **Kitty**; others
fall back gracefully). Unlike audio, images go *into* the terminal display, so they can't
just be a string the renderer measures and diffs. Instead the source transmits the image
bytes **once, out of band**, then the view places it by printing ordinary width-1
placeholder cells that ride the normal frame pipeline.

Keep the source in `session` (like the audio player) so its one-time-transmit state
survives re-renders, and render it through `Charming::Components::Image`:

```ruby
def show
  image = session[:logo] ||= Charming::Image::Source.new(path: "logo.png")
  render LogoView.new(image: image, screen: screen, controller: self)
end

# in the view:
render_component(Charming::Components::Image.new(source: image, rows: 8, cols: 16, fallback: "[logo]"))
```

How the pieces fit: `Charming::Image::Terminal` (injectable `env:`) detects the protocol;
`Charming::Image::Protocol::Kitty` builds both the out-of-band transmit (base64-chunked
APC, `q=2`) and the placeholder block (the image id is carried as an **exact** truecolor
foreground — never route it through `UI` styling, whose color downconversion would corrupt
it). The transmit rides the shared out-of-band channel (see below) and the component renders
the `fallback` string on terminals without graphics support.

---

### Out-of-band terminal effects

`Charming::Escape` is the shared channel for escape sequences that must reach the terminal
**before** the next frame, bypassing the line-based renderer (which measures width and would
shred raw control sequences). Anything responding to `#payload` rides it: image transmissions
(`Charming::Image::Transmit`) plus the `Charming::Escape` builders for clipboard (OSC 52),
notifications (OSC 9/777), bell, and window title (OSC 0) — all of which sanitize interpolated
text so it can't break out of the sequence.

Sequences are gathered during a dispatch via a thread-local collector (`Escape.collecting` /
`Escape.register`); the **Runtime** opens the collection around the whole event→response region
(so timer/mouse/paste-driven effects are caught too), attaches the collected list to
`Response#escapes`, and flushes it via `backend.write_escape` ahead of the frame.
`MemoryBackend#escapes` captures it in specs.

Controllers get imperative helpers (`Charming::Controller::Terminal`): `copy(text)`,
`notify(body, title:)`, `bell`, `set_title(text)` — call them in an action alongside a normal
`render`:

```ruby
def copy_url
  copy(state.url)
  notify("Copied!", title: "MyApp")
  render :show
end
```

### Data visualization

Pure-text, works on every terminal (no graphics protocol):

- `Charming::UI::BrailleCanvas` — a subpixel drawing surface backed by braille glyphs (U+2800–U+28FF),
  2×4 dots per cell. `new(width_px, height_px)`, `set(x, y)` / `unset` / `line(x0,y0,x1,y1)` (Bresenham),
  `to_s` → braille rows. Composes via `row`/`column`/`Canvas`.
- `Charming::Components::Sparkline` — a series → one-line `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` bar graph, one cell per value.
- `Charming::Components::Chart` — `kind: :line` (default) plots a connected line on a `BrailleCanvas`;
  `kind: :bar` draws vertical eighth-block bars. Sized in cells (`width:`/`height:`), optional `style:`.

---

## Code Style (Standard Ruby)

- **Ruby 4.0+** target
- `frozen_string_literal: true` on every file
- Use `bin/format` for auto-formatting
- Use `bin/lint` for style checks
- Follow Standard Ruby formatting rather than invoking RuboCop directly

---

## Testing

RSpec specs live in `spec/`. The `MemoryBackend` is used almost exclusively in specs so no real TTY is needed.

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb   # single file
bundle exec rspec                               # all specs
```

When adding specs for a backend-dependent feature, prefer `MemoryBackend` for unit specs and reserve `TTYBackend` for integration-level tests.

## Key Gotchas

1. **Controllers are ephemeral** — the Runtime creates new instances per event. Application state must live in `ApplicationState` objects stored in `session` via `Controller#state(...)`.
2. **Components inherit View** — they get `assigns`, helper methods, and `render`. They do NOT have their own lifecycle separate from `View`.
3. **`Charming.run(app)` is the entry point** — it instantiates `Runtime` with an optional backend. Tests pass `backend: MemoryBackend.new(...)` directly.
4. **Command palette keys take priority** — an open palette intercepts key events before controller `key_bindings`.
5. **Timers emit `TimerEvent`s** — controllers declare them with `timer :name, every: n, action: :method`; the runtime dispatches through `Controller#dispatch_timer`.
6. **`View#render` returns a string** — the controller wraps it in a `Response.render(...)` which `Runtime` sends to the renderer.
7. **`Screen` dimensions** flow: backend → runtime → controller (as `screen` arg) → view helpers. Use `@screen.width` and `@screen.height` in controllers for layout.
8. **The `render` view helper produces an `UI::Style`-styled string**, and controller `render(...)` wraps that in a response. Don't confuse them.
