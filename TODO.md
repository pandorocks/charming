# Charming TODO

Ruby TUI framework for Ruby 4+. Track of work to make this a proper production-ready framework.

## Priority 1 — Critical

- [x] Add mouse event support to TTYBackend
- [x] Add diffing renderer (or at minimum partial repaint option)
- [ ] Add API documentation and getting started guide
- [x] Add route parameters (`/users/:id`) for dynamic routing

## Priority 2 — Important

- [x] Add Table component — most requested widget in TUI frameworks
- [x] Add Progressbar component
- [x] Add missing common widgets: checkbox (MultiSelectList), tabs (TabBar), status bar (StatusBar) — plus Tree, Toast, Badge, Breadcrumbs, HelpOverlay, Autocomplete
- [x] Add formal backend interface module instead of duck-typing
- [ ] Separate view state from application state (don't store Viewport/Spinner in session)
- [ ] Expand layout features: wrapping, clipping, vertical alignment — min/max dimensions done

## Priority 3 — Minor

- [x] Fix inconsistent key types (symbols for named keys, strings for characters)
- [ ] Fix generator templates — use template engine instead of string concatenation
- [x] Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [x] Explicitly define `module Charming` in `lib/charming.rb`
- [x] Add fuzzy search to command palette (FuzzyMatcher, fzf-style scoring)
- [ ] Add property-based tests for UI styling system
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for rendered output
- [ ] Fill out `sig/charming.rbs` beyond `VERSION`

## Completed

- [x] Clean architecture with Application → Router → Controller → Model → View → Component → UI → Backend
- [x] Backend abstraction (TTYBackend, MemoryBackend)
- [x] Lip Gloss-inspired styling system
- [x] Generators for scaffolding
- [x] Command palette with filtering
- [x] Timer system with clock injection
- [x] Task executor and task events
- [x] View layouts and partial rendering
- [x] Themes loaded from bundled or app-local JSON
- [x] Table, progress bar, spinner, viewport, modal, list, text input, and activity indicator components
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with MemoryBackend
