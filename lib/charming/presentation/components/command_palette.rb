    # CommandPalette renders a fuzzy-searchable command picker UI. It wraps a TextInput for search
    # input and a List for result display, dispatching key events between them. Users type to filter
    # the registered commands by label match, navigate with up/down/home/end keys (delegated to List),
    # confirm a selection with Enter (returns [:selected, command]), or cancel with Escape (returns :cancelled).
