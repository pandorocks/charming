    # KeyDispatch resolves which handler claims a key event — the capture/bubble
    # ladder a browser would own in a web MVC app. Priority order:
    #
    # 1. Command palette (when open) consumes everything.
    # 2. A focused text-capturing component (TextInput, TextArea, Form, …) gets
    #    printable characters BEFORE key bindings — typing "q" into a field must
    #    insert a q, not quit the app.
    # 3. Global key bindings.
    # 4. An overlay focus scope (a pushed modal) captures all remaining keys.
    # 5. Sidebar keys (when focused), content bindings, then the focused component —
    #    which sees Tab before ring traversal so forms can do field navigation.
    #
    # Tiers differ in how they terminate: the palette, overlay, sidebar, and binding
    # tiers consume the key outright once their condition holds, while the component
    # tiers only consume it when the component reports :handled and otherwise let it
    # fall through to the next tier.
